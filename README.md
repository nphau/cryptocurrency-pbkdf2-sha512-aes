## ðŸ‘‡ 1. PBKDF2

PBKDF2 is a password-based key derivation function. In many applications of cryptography, user security is ultimately dependent on a password,
    and because a password usually can't be used directly as a cryptographic key, some processing is required.
    A salt provides a large set of keys for any given password, and an iteration count increases the cost of producing keys from a password,
    thereby also increasing the difficulty of attack.

## ðŸ‘‡ 2. SHA-2

SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) 
      and first published in 2001.[3][4] They are built using the Merkleâ€“DamgÃ¥rd construction, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Daviesâ€“Meyer 
      structure from a specialized block cipher

## ðŸ‘‡ 3. AES
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael 
      is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by
      the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.[4]

# ðŸš€ Encrypt

Using PBKDF2 to generate key derivation:

```
let encryptedKey = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(password, salt, { hasher: CryptoJS.algo.SHA512, keySize, iterations });
```

Using AES with custom IV to encode

```
let encryptedMessage = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(planText, encryptedKey, { iv: iv });
```

# ðŸš€ Decrypt
Using PBKDF2 to generate key derivation:

```
let decryptedKey = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(password, salt, { hasher: CryptoJS.algo.SHA512, keySize, iterations });
```

Using AES with custom IV to decode

```
let decryptedMessage = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedMessage, decryptedKey, { iv: iv });
```
