CryptoJS - PBKDF2 - SHA512 - AES
--------

PBKDF2 is a password-based key derivation function. In many applications of cryptography, user security is ultimately dependent on a password,
    and because a password usually can't be used directly as a cryptographic key, some processing is required.
    A salt provides a large set of keys for any given password, and an iteration count increases the cost of producing keys from a password,
    thereby also increasing the difficulty of attack.

# Encrypt

Using PBKDF2 to generate key derivation:

```
let encryptedKey = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(password, salt, { hasher: CryptoJS.algo.SHA512, keySize, iterations });
```

Using AES with custom IV to encode

```
let encryptedMessage = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(planText, encryptedKey, { iv: iv });
```

# Decrypt
Using PBKDF2 to generate key derivation:

```
let decryptedKey = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(password, salt, { hasher: CryptoJS.algo.SHA512, keySize, iterations });
```

Using AES with custom IV to decode

```
let decryptedMessage = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedMessage, decryptedKey, { iv: iv });
```
